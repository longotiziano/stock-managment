# Controllers

This folder contains the logic that coordinates the application's operations.
Controllers act as intermediaries between the input (e.g., user or API calls) and the underlying business logic and data access layers.

## Responsibilities
- Orchestrate data flow between verifiers, repositories, and models.
- Convert and process data structures (e.g., between DataFrames and model formats).
- Handle higher-level workflows such as stock updates or sales registrations.
